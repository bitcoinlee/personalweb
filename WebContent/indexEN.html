						<h3>Market Research</h3>
						<div>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research"
									target="_blank">Market research</a> is any organized effort to
								gather information about markets or customers. It is a very
								important component of business strategy. The term is commonly
								interchanged with marketing research; however, expert
								practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in that marketing
								research is concerned specifically about marketing processes,
								while market research is concerned specifically with markets.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Market research is a key
								factor to get advantage over competitors. Market research
								provides important information to identify and analyze the
								market need, market size and competition.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Market research, which
								includes social and opinion research, is the systematic
								gathering and interpretation of information about individuals or
								organizations using statistical and analytical methods and
								techniques of the applied social sciences to gain insight or
								support decision making.</p>

						<h3>Marketing Mix Modeling</h3>
						<div>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling"
									target="_blank">Marketing mix modeling (MMM)</a> is a term of
								art for the use of statistical analysis such as multivariate
								regressions on sales and marketing time series data to estimate
								the impact of various marketing tactics (marketing mix) on sales
								and then forecast the impact of future sets of tactics. It is
								often used to optimize advertising mix and promotional tactics
								with respect to sales revenue or profit.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">The techniques were developed by
								econometricians and were first applied to consumer packaged
								goods, since manufacturers of those goods had access to good
								data on sales and marketing support. Early pioneer-users of
								econometric modeling were the ATG group at the advertising
								agency JWT in the 1990s and the specialist modeling agency OHAL
								since the late 1980s. These agencies took MMM from being a
								little-used and academic discipline to being a widespread and
								common marketing tool. Improved availability of data, massively
								greater computing power, and the pressure to measure and
								optimize marketing spend has driven the explosion in popularity
								as a marketing tool. In the recent times MMM has found
								acceptance as a trustworthy marketing tool among the major
								consumer marketing companies. Often in the digital media
								context, MMM is referred to as attribution modeling.</p>

						<h3>Market segmentation</h3>
						<div>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segment"
									target="_blank">Market segmentation</a> is a marketing strategy
								that involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of
								consumers who have common needs, and then designing and
								implementing strategies to target their needs and desires using
								media channels and other touch-points that best allow to reach
								them.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Market segments allow
								companies to create product differentiation strategies to target
								them.</p>
